## Smart City Parking App


This was the main project for the course Web Programming & Systems. <br>

The goal of this project was the deployment of a system, simulating parking managment for a number of cities, through smart sensors.<br>


Full project description can be found in Project_Presentation/Ergastiriaki_Askisi_18_19.pdf and a brief presentation of what the project was about in Project_Presentation/Parousiasi-erg-askisis.pdf. <br>

I encourage you to read through the project description or at least the project presentation to get a glimpse of what the frontend and backend requirements were about.
